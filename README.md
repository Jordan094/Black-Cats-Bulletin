# Design

## Colour Pallete

![Black Cats Bulletin Colour Pallette](/assets/images/readme-images/colour-pallette.png)
[Pallette Created Using Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)

I have chosen the above colour pallette as I wanted to stay true to the colours of the Sunderland AFC team Red being the primary colour and White the secondary. I chose neutral gray colours to make sure there was no clashes. I have also used the Coolors contrast checker to ensure these are suitable.

## Typography

I have chosen the Lunasima Font. This is provided by Google Fonts and [can be found here.](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lunasima)

I have used the regular font weight for standard text and chosen a weight of 600 when adding emphasis such as on the heading and title text.

I have selected sans-serif to be the default font if Lunasima can not be loaded.

## Images Used

The bulk of the images used have been sourced from Sunderland AFC's official site. However, special thanks to [sjhoward.co.uk](https://sjhoward.co.uk) for the hero image.

All images used have been carefully selected and have a high resolution to ensure they can be displayed clearly on the website.

## Videos

The results section of the website has external links to the official clubs youtube channel which uploads highlight reels of each game played.

## Icons

The websites footer uses fontawesome icons for external links to social media pages and also quick email and phone contact buttons. This is to make the footer easy to understand and have a simple clean layout.

# Structure

## Website Layout

The website has been designed using HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap 5 with a mobile first approach

All pages on the website contain the same format navigation bar and footer.

## Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is designed in a mobile first format with a hamburger button to expand the options for different pages. The background colour is red and the text is white. When viewing on a large device screen for example a desktop, all of the menu options will be visible.

* The menu options are as follows:
* Home

## Footer

The footer for the website is simple and clean and easy for the user to understand. On the left there is fontawesome icons for social media pages and on the right of the page there is fontawesome icons for the contact and email sections. The design of the footer means that when the page is viewed on different size devices there is minimal change to the layout.

The Home page (index.html) consists of the Nav-bar, Hero Image, 3 previews of the main blocks of content (latest news, next fixture, condensed league table.) the latest news section and next fixture block takes you to their respective full web pages when pressed, whilst the condensed league table loads a full sized imag.
