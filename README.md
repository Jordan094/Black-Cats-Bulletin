# **Design**

## Colour Pallete

![Black Cats Bulletin Colour Pallette](/assets/images/readme-images/colours/colour-pallette.png)
[Pallette Created Using Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)

I have chosen the above colour pallette as I wanted to stay true to the colours of the Sunderland AFC team Red being the primary colour and White the secondary. I chose neutral gray colours to make sure there was no clashes. I have also used the Coolors contrast checker to ensure these are suitable.

## Typography

I have chosen the Lunasima Font. This is provided by Google Fonts and [can be found here.](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lunasima)

I have used the regular font weight for standard text and chosen a weight of 600 when adding emphasis such as on the heading and title text.

I have selected sans-serif to be the default font if Lunasima can not be loaded.

## Images Used

The bulk of the images used have been sourced from Sunderland AFC's official site. However, special thanks to [sjhoward.co.uk](https://sjhoward.co.uk) for the hero image.

All images used have been carefully selected and have a high resolution to ensure they can be displayed clearly on the website.

## Videos

The results section of the website has external links to the official clubs youtube channel which uploads highlight reels of each game played.

## Icons

The websites footer uses fontawesome icons for external links to social media pages and also quick email and phone contact buttons. This is to make the footer easy to understand and have a simple clean layout.

## Widgets

As the website contains a lot of information that changes multiple times throughout the week. To keep it as up to date as possible I have chosen to use embedded widgets on my page. The website [Fctables](https://www.fctables.com/widgets/) offers a wide variety of football related widgets to chose from. I chosen to use the Next Match widget - which is live and also shows the score live during a game and the league table widget, the league table widget also updates live with all of the games being played and you are able to customise the widget to your liking by using either the designer provided or by editing the HTML code given.

# **Structure**

## Website Layout

The website has been designed using HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap 5 with a mobile first approach
All pages on the website contain the same format navigation bar and footer for continuity purposes.

* The website contains a homepage and then 4 other pages. News, Fixutres and Results, Join the club and 404.
  * Homepage - First page user will come to, provided an overview of the site and links to other pages.
  * News - Has news and updates about the club
  * Fixtures - Shows the latest fixtures and recent results.
  * Join the club - Has 2 options. Join the club fully (Create an account) or sign up for email updates.
  * Sign up success page - Confirming you have joined the club.
  * 404 Page - A page I do not intend users to find. This page should only be displayed when there is a broken URL.

## Header

![Header Styles](/assets/images/readme-images/features/header-types.png)
The header contains navigation bar which is designed in a mobile first format with a hamburger button to expand the options for different pages. The background colour is red and the text is white. When viewing on a large device screen for example a desktop, all of the menu options will be visible.

* The menu options are as follows:

## Footer

![Footer Styles](/assets/images/readme-images/features/footer-types.png)
The footer for the website is simple and clean and easy for the user to understand. On the left there is fontawesome icons for social media pages and on the right of the page there is fontawesome icons for the contact and email sections. The design of the footer means that when the page is viewed on different size devices there is minimal change to the layout.

## Home Page

The footer is present at the bottom of the page.

The fixtures page (fixtures.html) consists of the header, followed by a HTML table. Inside the HTML table there is 2 tabs.  Firstly there is the fixtures tab. It shows the 5 newest fixtures of the club. Each fixture will contain a link to an external site to view team stats. The second tab is a Results tab. It contains the 5 most recent results. Each result contains a hyperlink to an embedded youtube video with the match highlights. The footer is present at the bottom of the page.

The fixtures page contains the same responsive elements for the header and footer that the other pages do but the table sizes adjusts to display correctly on which ever size device it is being viewed on.

# **Technologies Used**

* [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
  * HTML was used to create the web page
* [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)
  * CSS was used to style the web page
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  * I used github to create my repository and store my projects code.
* [Code Anywhere](https://app.codeanywhere.com/)
  * I used Code Anywhere as my IDE
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/)
  * I tested my website and responsiveness throught creation using chrome developer tools.
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
  * Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
  * I used the font Lunasima which is a Google font, with a fallback font of Sans-Serif thoughout my whole project.
* [Am I Responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)
  * This was used to test the responsiveness on all devices once the pages were complete.
* [W3 Schools HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
  * This was used to check for any HTML errors in the code.
* [W3 Schools CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
  * This was used to check for any HTML errors in the code.
* [FCtables](https://www.fctables.com/widgets/)
  * I used this website to generate live widgets to embed in to my own page.

# **Accessibility**

I wanted to ensure that the website was fully accessible. I have done this by doing the following:

* Providing Alternative Text (Alt Text)
  * I've made sure to add descriptive alternative text (alt text) to all images on the website. Alt text adds context to images, enabling users who rely on screen readers to understand the visual content even if they can't see it.
* Ensuring Color Contrast
  * I've chosen color combinations that maintain accessible contrast ratios, ensuring that text remains readable against different background colors. This benefits users with visual impairments or color blindness.
* Responsive Design
  * The site is designed to adapt to various devices and screen sizes. This caters to users who rely on different devices or have specific accessibility requirements.

## Validation and Tools

### W3C Validation Tools

Once my pages were complete I used [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure my code had no errors.

The following errors were encountered:

* My Widgets used from FCTables had an obsolete element of frameborder and to use CSS instead on my index page and league table section. As no frame border was needed, I removed this element from the HTML code.
* My Widgets used from FCTables had an obsolete element of scrolling and to use CSS instead on my index page and league table section this was only present on my league table section however as this element was set to no and was needed I removed this element from the HTML code.
* I had left a stray 'a' element in my footer. This has now been removed.  

I also used [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to ensure my code has no CSS errors. This came back as a pass.

Below are my Validation Passes.
