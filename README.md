## Colour Pallete

[Black Cats Bulletin Colour Pallette](/assets/images/readme-images/Colour-pallette.png)
[Pallette Created Using Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)

I have went with the above colour pallette as I wanted to stay true to the colours of the Sunderland AFC team Red being the primary colour and White the secondary. I chose neutral gray colours to make sure there was no clashes. I have also used the Coolors contrast checker to ensure these are suitable.
